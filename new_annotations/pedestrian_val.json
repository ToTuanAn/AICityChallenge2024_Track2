            "The pedestrian, a male in his 30s with a height of 170 cm, was wearing a black T-shirt and light blue slacks. He was walking on a level asphalt road in close proximity to a vehicle. His body was oriented in the opposite direction to the vehicle, with the vehicle directly in front of him. However, his eyes were closed, indicating an unawareness of the vehicle's presence. Despite being in front of the vehicle, he was not able to see it due to his line of sight being focused on the vehicle itself. Unfortunately, a collision occurred between the pedestrian and the vehicle."

The pedestrian's line of sight was fixated on the vehicle, indicating his awareness of its presence. Despite the wet road conditions and slow speed, the pedestrian was almost noticed by the driver. His attire consisted of a black T-shirt on the upper body and gray slacks on the lower body, paired with glasses. As the pedestrian slowly moved forward, he suddenly found himself thrown back, suggesting an unexpected event.

            "A male pedestrian in his 30s, standing still, was observed on a residential road. He was perpendicular to the vehicle and positioned diagonally to the left in front of it. Despite the pedestrian's unawareness of the vehicle's presence, he closely watched the road ahead, facing in the same direction as the oncoming traffic. The pedestrian's line of sight was unobstructed due to the bright daylight with cloudy weather conditions. The road surface was dry and level, made of asphalt, and traffic volume was light. The pedestrian's visual status was not hindered, and he was not wearing any distinguishing clothing apart from a black hat, black T-shirt, and black slacks. There were two lanes for two-way traffic on the road, but not both sides had a sidewalk or roadside strip. Overall, the environment seemed conducive to pedestrian safety, given the pedestrian's attention to the road and the calm traffic on the residential street.",

He is positioned diagonally to the left in front of a vehicle, with his body oriented perpendicular to it. With a far relative distance from the vehicle, the pedestrian's line of sight is directed in front, following the direction of travel. Although he is closely watching, the pedestrian is unaware of the vehicle's presence. He is dressed in a black T-shirt and slacks, wearing a black hat. The weather is cloudy, but the brightness of the surroundings is bright. The road surface conditions are dry and the road is level with asphalt. The traffic volume is light on this two-way traffic road, which does not have sidewalks on both sides or roadside strips. In this simple event, the pedestrian remains motionless and appears to be unaware of the vehicle near him, as he stands on the residential road.",

            "A male pedestrian in his 20s, approximately 170 cm tall, wearing a black T-shirt and black slacks, was spotted standing still on a residential road. He had his back facing perpendicular to the vehicle and was positioned diagonally to the left in front of it. The pedestrian's line of sight was focused directly in front, aligned with the direction of travel. Despite the bright and cloudy weather, he appeared to be closely watching his surroundings. However, he seemed unaware of the vehicle, which was light in traffic volume, approaching from the same direction. The road surface conditions were dry and level, with asphalt as the surface type. There were two-way traffic and no sidewalks or roadside strips on both sides. The environment was restricted, and the pedestrian was equipped with glasses.",
            "The pedestrian, a male in his 20s, was standing diagonally to the left in front of the vehicle. His body was perpendicular to the vehicle's orientation, which was to the right. Even though the pedestrian seemed to be far from the vehicle, he was closely watching its direction of travel. Unaware of the vehicle's presence, the pedestrian was dressed in a black T-shirt and black slacks, standing at a height of approximately 170 cm. Wearing glasses, he was in a bright and cloudy environment, with the road surface being dry and level. The residential road had a light traffic volume and consisted of two-way traffic. The pedestrian was positioned on a road without sidewalks on both sides, as well as roadside strips. It was a typical day with asphalt road surface type, and the pedestrian's action involved him simply going straight ahead at a slow speed.",
            "The pedestrian, a male in his 20s, stood near the vehicle with his body perpendicular and to the right. His line of sight was fixed on his destination across the road as he was completely unaware of the presence of the vehicle. Wearing a black T-shirt and black slacks, his gaze closely watched the surroundings with a slow pace. The cloudy and bright weather provided ample visibility for the pedestrian on the dry asphalt road. Despite the light traffic volume on the two-way residential road, the pedestrian's attention was solely focused on going straight ahead. The pedestrian's glasses added an extra element to his visual status. With the road surface level and neither a sidewalk nor roadside strip available, the pedestrian maneuvered diagonally to the left in front of the vehicle, taking careful steps in his restricted environment.",
            "The pedestrian, a male in his 20s measuring approximately 170 cm in height, is wearing black clothing consisting of a T-shirt on the upper body and slacks on the lower body. With glasses on, he stands fairly close to the vehicle, positioned directly in front of it. His body is perpendicular to the vehicle and to the right. His line of sight is focused on the vehicle, and he is closely watching it. Although he has almost noticed the vehicle, his awareness is not fully directed towards it. Suddenly, an event occurs, causing the pedestrian to be thrown back. The environment conditions during this incident include cloudy weather with bright brightness. The road surface is dry and level, composed of asphalt. The traffic volume is light on the residential road, which consists of two-way traffic. There is no sidewalk or roadside strip on both sides of the road, and the area is restricted."
