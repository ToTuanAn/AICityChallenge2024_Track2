            "The pedestrian, a male in his 20s wearing a black T-shirt and slacks, found himself in a clear and bright environment on a residential road with two-way traffic. It was a usual day, with dry road surface conditions on level asphalt. There were no sidewalks on both sides, and neither were there roadside strips on both sides. However, street lights illuminated the surroundings. As he walked diagonally in front and to the right of the vehicle, which was slowly moving, his body was oriented in the opposite direction to the vehicle. The pedestrian closely watched his surroundings, his line of sight to the right in the direction of travel. Being near the vehicle, he was cautiously going straight ahead, aware of his relative distance from the vehicle. The pedestrian's visual status seemed to be unimpaired, allowing him to carefully navigate the situation.",
            "The pedestrian, a male in his 20s, was wearing a black T-shirt and black slacks. He stood diagonally to the right, in front of the vehicle on a clear, bright day. The pedestrian was closely watching the vehicle, his line of sight directed to the right, in the direction of travel. He was positioned close to the vehicle, and his body was oriented diagonally to the left, in the opposite direction of the vehicle. The pedestrian's visual status indicated that he was closely watching the vehicle as he rushed out. Moving at a high speed, he was going straight ahead diagonally in front of the vehicle. The road conditions were dry, with asphalt as the road surface type. It was a residential road with two-way traffic and a usual traffic volume. There were no sidewalks, roadside strips, or street lights on both sides of the road. The pedestrian's surroundings provided ample visibility, allowing him to closely observe the vehicle and proceed with caution.",
            "The pedestrian, a male in his 20s, stands diagonally to the left of the vehicle, facing in the opposite direction. His body is positioned directly in front of the vehicle, at a close distance. With his line of sight focused on the vehicle, he seems almost aware of its presence. Suddenly, he rushes out, his general action leading to a collision. The bright and clear weather, coupled with the dry road surface, creates favorable conditions for the event to unfold on the residential road. The two-way traffic road, lacking sidewalks on both sides, witnesses the presence of street lights. The man is dressed in a black t-shirt and black slacks, his height measured at 170 cm. Despite the usual traffic volume, the street appears to be inclined at a level angle, paved with asphalt. The environment conditions are meticulously detailed, providing a clear snapshot of the scene."

He had a height of 170 cm and was holding a smartphone in his hand, looking around slowly. He appeared unaware of the vehicle approaching from behind in the opposite direction. The pedestrian's body orientation indicated that he was facing the opposite direction of the vehicle, while his position was behind it. Despite being near the vehicle, the pedestrian seemed engrossed in his smartphone, unaware of the potential danger. He was not on a sidewalk but was traveling on the left side of the road.

Despite his awareness of the vehicle, the unfortunate circumstances led to the two entities colliding. The traffic volume was light, with the road having two-way traffic. The environment conditions and the pedestrian's position in relation to the vehicle played a crucial role in this unfortunate event."

            "A male pedestrian in his 30s, measuring around 170 cm in height, wearing a black T-shirt and black slacks, finds himself on a residential road characterized by a dimly lit, cloudy environment. The road consists of a level, dry asphalt surface with light traffic flowing in both directions. On this particular day, the pedestrian stands diagonally to the left in front of a vehicle, closely watching the road ahead. Unaware of the vehicle, the pedestrian's body is oriented in the same direction as the vehicle, and their line of sight is focused straight ahead in the direction of travel. They are moving at a slightly higher speed while going straight ahead, presumably within a car lane. Despite the lack of visibility, street lights illuminate the surroundings, and there is no sidewalk or roadside strip on either side of the road.",

The road surface is dry and the road is level. The pedestrian is positioned diagonally to the left in front of the vehicle, facing the same direction as the vehicle. He is closely watching his surroundings and unaware of the vehicle's presence. His line of sight is focused in front, in the direction of travel. The pedestrian is going straight ahead at a slightly higher speed, traveling in a car lane on a residential road with two-way traffic and light traffic volume. There is no sidewalk or roadside strip on both sides of the road, but there are street lights. Overall, the pedestrian and environmental conditions indicate that he is walking alone on a dimly lit residential road, paying close attention to his surroundings but not aware of the presence of the vehicle.",
            "A male pedestrian in his 30s, approximately 170 cm tall, wearing a black T-shirt and slacks, finds himself in a cloudy and dimly lit environment. The pedestrian is standing directly in front of a vehicle on a dry asphalt road in a residential area with light traffic. The road has two-way traffic and does not have a sidewalk or roadside strip on both sides. Despite the lack of lighting, street lights are present. The pedestrian notices the vehicle moving diagonally in front and to the right while closely watching it. The pedestrian's body is oriented diagonally to the right, following the same direction as the vehicle. In the pedestrian's line of sight, the vehicle remains in focus. Suddenly, the pedestrian is thrown back, suggesting a specific action. It is worth noting that the pedestrian's visual status and awareness of the vehicle are both factors indicating their attentiveness in this event."

            "The pedestrian, a male in his 30s wearing a black t-shirt and slacks, was walking on a cloudy and dim day along a residential road. He was in close proximity to a vehicle directly in front of him. His body was oriented in the opposite direction of the vehicle, and his line of sight was towards it. Despite noticing the vehicle, the pedestrian was rushing out in a diagonal direction, slightly towards the front and to the left. The pedestrian's speed was slightly higher than normal. The road surface was dry and level, made of asphalt, with light traffic volume. The road had two-way traffic, and the event took place at an intersection controlled by a traffic signal. There was no sidewalk on both sides, and neither were there roadside strips on both sides. However, street lights were present. In this scenario, the pedestrian and the vehicle collided, potentially due to the pedestrian's sudden actions and the slightly higher speed at which he was moving."

            "A male pedestrian in his thirties, approximately 170 cm tall, wearing a black T-shirt and black slacks, found himself standing still near a vehicle on a dimly lit, clear night. His body was perpendicular to the vehicle and positioned diagonally to the left in front of it. The pedestrian was closely watching his surroundings, with his line of sight in front, aligned with the direction of travel. Unaware of the vehicle's presence, he stood near it. The environment conditions were favorable, with a dry, level asphalt road in a light traffic area. The residential road had two-way traffic and lacked sidewalks on both sides. Street lights provided illumination, but there was an obstacle diagonally to the right in front of the pedestrian, measuring 2 meters in height and 3 meters in width.",
